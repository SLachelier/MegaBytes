### Goal and Requirements

Our goal was to create an easily accessible way to find the top rated restaurants in any city in the world. Using bulma, jquery, javascript, HTML, and CSS we were able to create the MegaBytes web app. We collaborated virtually both during and outside of class. From setting up the wireframe to wrapping up the smallest design details we made sure to actively and thoroughly communicate. We resolved issues in real time using collective knowledge. Creating a sense of “team” and “success” as each issue was resolved. Utilizing each other’s strengths while learning our weak points and taking steps to improve our individual skills. 

Our goals for the future are:

Refining the framework 
Applying even more locations
Enabling search criteria
Fine tuning mobile design/functionality
Enabling use of “enter” key to initiate search
Developing a users favorites page

* *No major disparities in the number of GitHub contributions between group members.*
